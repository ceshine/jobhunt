Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font><hr/><font color=\"#000000\">MaxMind - <a href=\"https://www.maxmind.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.maxmind.com/</a> - REMOTE (US and Canada)<p>Email careers@maxmind.com.

Tasks will include improving existing components and creating new systems for scaling, automating and monitoring of processes. Knowledge of Perl &amp; Bash is expected, however if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more comfortable with another dynamic language like Python or Ruby and have a good grasp of low level Linux, we should still talk. Familiarity with C would also be an advantage.</p><p>As a UX designer you will be responsible for a creating the UIs and improving the UX of Omniata's web interfaces that allow Omniata's customers to make the most of their data. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript would be a plus, but is not a must.</p><p>If you're at all interested in this area and Helsinki as a place to live and work, drop a one line email with a link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile (in the case of backend) or portfolio (in the case of UX) to careers-hl@omniata.com</p></font><hr/><font color=\"#000000\">San Francisco - PlanGrid (YC12).

We intend to own the construction software business, which is vastly under-served. The market is huge; construction is a multi-trillion dollar industry globally that still operates like they did in 1950. Our customers are so happy that up until the past three months we've had no marketing or sales whatsoever - we were profitable in year one just from word of mouth.</p><p>Our primary hiring philosophy is as follows: Wicked smart, NO DICKS.</p><p>We are looking for engineering and non-engineering positions.

Small but growing team.</p><p>* Backend/API. Python and mongo, but we're investigating alternatives (Postgres? FoundationDB?) because we are steam-rolling to the trillion-with-a-capital-T mark on records.</p><p>* Windows. We are just starting this team so you have complete freedom. Will probably be C# with a shared library supporting a Desktop app and RT app.</p><p>* Data Science. You would think blueprints were created by professionals with standards. You'd be wrong. Put your machine learning skills to work on real world problems where a 1% improvement saves man-years of effort.</p><p>* Web. We do some real magic on the web; check out our blueprint annotating.
